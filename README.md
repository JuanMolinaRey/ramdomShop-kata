### 
- Magic card modification. The age of Magic cards can influence their price. 
Blue and red cards cost half as much when they are over 10 years old. Black and green cards cost 20% more when they are over 20 years old.
  
- They want to add pet spiders to the store, for each leg they ask for 1.20 euros and depending 
on the spider, 2 euros will be added for being red and 3 euros for being golden, a 50% discount will also be applied if the spider is stinky

## Test description:
###
- We had to create several tests to calculate the price of each Magic card according to its color, apart from the Black Lotus category.
- We also create other tests so that depending on the age of each card.
- We added tests to calculate the value of the spider according to its legs, depending on what color they are and whether it is stinky or not.
- We add two tests to calculate the value of the fish depending on what color it is.
